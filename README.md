# Pizza-Yes-Pizza-No

Expanding my NN knowledge by applying different architectures to see how they perform in classifying an image between "Yes, it's a pizza!" and "No it sucks"

The dataset is taken from - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosrunner/pizza-not-pizza


You can test the app here - https://manomay15-pizza-yes-pizza-no-app-ymx8qb.streamlitapp.com/

The accuracy is not the highest though so please forgive any mistakes by the app :)
